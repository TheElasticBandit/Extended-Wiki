This update started the work on the [[high_elves_faction|High Elven]] factions in Eriador. Other than just adding Rivendell Npcs and overhauling the biome layout, this update also ported three key legacy features. Bandits and bandit encounters, Feast Mode (eating past the full point), and the modifier system (a lore friendly replacement for vanilla enchantments).
